    title: `The river - a lifeline.`,
    writeup: `This collection of images is a chronicle of visits to the river at various points, made over 10 years. In my travels across Assam and Arunachal Pradesh, I have always found myself never too far from its expansive landscapes or by a smaller tributary; often crossing paths with the waters - a privilege in itself. Growing up in Tinsukia, for instance, it was a thirty-minute drive to the Dibru- Saikhowa National Park which became our de-facto day out and also where my family would take their guests first. News of the gas blowout near the park last year was gut-wrenching to live with, since I personally knew many boat operators and guides whose families depended upon the river for their livelihoods. \nThese images speak to what the river means to me but more importantly for the people who arrive at it daily. Sustenance, transport, tourism and devotion each greatly direct the lives of many at its shores, this is an assortment of visuals in homage to the Brahmaputra and its people. The river is life itself.`,
    bio: `I grew up in Assam, India and moved to Bombay to study mass media - where I learned more about photography and visual practices while beginning to work on my own self-funded projects. In addition to a bachelor’s degree in Mass Media (BMM) from Jai Hind College, Mumbai University, I also have diplomas in filmmaking, photography, and sound production from NYFA, Udaan School of Photography and SRFTI respectively. My work revolves around observational and journalistic stories such as the documentation of disabled artists in India and an ongoing long-term project about mass migration in Uttarakhand. I am a visual artist working with photography and video mixed as conduits for my creative expression; with interest in further blurring the line between the two mediums - as far as is possible while each complements the other. I am continually looking to improve as a storyteller and delve deeper into the use of expressionist and abstract methods in that pursuit`,

    writeup: `Chars or sandbanks in the Brahmaputra are home to approximately twenty-five lakh people whose lives are like shifting sand. \nWhen Amitav Ghosh, in the title of his book, The Hungry Tide, personifies the tide to hunger, it extends beyond its literal sense to show how islanders fight with calamitous environment each day, yet choose to live with it. He writes: \n“…transformation is the rule of life: rivers stray from week to week, and islands are made and unmade in days.” (Ghosh, 2005)\n LIVING WITH THE RIVER\n Pagla Nodi or ‘mad river’ is a song of the boatmen.

India is a land of festivals that are celebrated throughout the year in different corners of the country with joy and enthusiasm. Lakhs of devotees from across the country gather every day at River Banks to offer prayers. There are different rituals that take place, mainly in the Morning and in the Evening, to complete these rituals, devotees have to stand at the banks of the rivers for long hours. Standing in a river and praying release energy from your body. It is believed that these rituals of standing in the water and praying detoxify the body and mind and provides mental calmness. It also enhances immunity, infuses energy and reduces the frequency of anger, and all other negative emotions`,

    title: `Women of the river, from the floodplains of Assam`,
    writeup: `Assam has a diverse group of communities, and the role of the women within these communities also sometimes remain the same in the private while changing constantly in the public. The women of the tribal communities in Assam (specifically Deori and Mishing) are engaged both at the private and public space from household activities and looking after the family to agricultural activities (Picture 1 – Women in the agricultural field in Majuli), fishing, and fetching wood for cooking. This often overburden the women. Especially during the harvest season, they barely have time left for themselves. The mornings are for household work of cleaning and cooking, then spending the entire day at the field, and then coming back home and engaging in domestic chores again. But within the public sphere, there is a clear gender divide in the public. Women engage in the activities of sowing and reaping in the agricultural field, while the men engage in ploughing and carrying the reaped harvest from the field (heavy load). Women use the jakoi (Picture 2 – Women from Sadiya with jakoi) as an equipment for catching fish, while men generally use fishing nets. The men usually row the boats, while the women are often discouraged and unless absolutely necessary (Picture 3 – Man and woman in a boat in Majuli). While the women from the lower reaches of Assam don’t really engage in the public sphere as much, fishing (Picture 4 – Woman engaging in fishing, from 2017 flood, while on the way to Dhubri) as an activity during the flood season diminishes the gender roles as both the genders engage in it as an alternative source of livelihood. Within the char communities, the engagement of women with the public space tends to be even less with their mobility being restricted often to the compound of their house, but like the other communities within the private space they are the primary caretakers (Picture 5 – Woman simultaneously conducting chore and taking care of her child during flood, from a char in Goalpara), often left with trauma upon loss.`,

I missed my friends, the hills, the abundance of greens but most of all I missed the river from my backyard. The might of the river of been lavishly written about. Her travel from Himalaya to Bay of Bengal is an adventure in itself. Her ever-changing forms imitate life. How she makes people feel is spun into poems and songs. I strongly believe that the river has a pull, an attraction, a gravity of its own which plays on people of all kinds – fisher folk, farmers, dating couples, children, elders and on me. While identities of people in North East often clash in insider-outsider binaries, the river unifies. She connects the disconnected. She can bridge boundaries and borders. After studying and working across India, this enormity of the Brahmaputra pulled me back to her after 20 years. Now when I touch her waters, it feels as if I never left. She is the center of my friendships in the city. She is my family here.`,

    writeup: `The mighty Brahmaputra has been the harbinger of life for the city of Guwahati to the point that the city cannot even be imagined without it. Despite the destructive annual floods which lead to loss of land, life and livestock, the river remains the most cherished attribute of the city. For a state dependent on rice cultivation and fishing, the river is undoubtedly the primary source of life and livelihood. One cannot easily comprehend the magnitude of the Brahmaputra’s impact on the lives of the people of the city of Guwahati, and the state of Assam at large. \nSettlements by the banks of rivers are a common phenomenon across the world. Given the alluvial soil around the Brahmaputra, it is only natural that populations have settled very close to its shores. For the people who have settled in colonies just by the banks, the river means more to them than a mainstream city dweller could ever imagine. Their day begins with a prayer to the sun, taking a holy dip in the water. Their livelihood depends mostly on the river; some belong to fishing communities, cloth washing communities, boating communities, and vendors who bring produce from their remote villages in the ferries to be sold in the city. \nThese images depict similar instances; life in the river. They reflect how these people mark a positive beginning to their day - taking a holy dip at dawn, invoking the blessings of the sun and the river god; and setting off to work for the day. All these images offer the Saraighat bridge at the backdrop, which is one of the most remarkable pieces of infrastructure built on the Brahmaputra. Built between the years 1958 and 1962, this bridge connects North and South Guwahati, which are otherwise separated by the Brahmaputra. Considering its rich history, the Saraighat bridge poses as a mark of culture and is a major part of the heritage of the city and the state.`,

    writeup: `The son of Brahma, river Brahmaputra has been a source of life, livelihood and inspiration for many. The strength and agility of this river making its way amidst the steep cut mountains to the valleys of culture, signifies a powerful journey called life. The serene, quite, and otherwise calm nature of the river symbolizing the enchanting hues of existence goes along with the wrath of that furious rage where it strives for freedom reflecting on the turmoil, distress and tumultuous waters of the region. The river is us and its primordial voyage from the cradle of dawn to the heights of civilization is the decadence of mankind. \nWhat is it to live with something? Is it the same as livelihood? Is it more, is it less? It is definitely much more. The river correlates with people’s emotions, they need to flow. River makes emotions look like energy in motion. Stopping the flow means blocking the energy. Thus it surely is not about the livelihood. It encompasses the sentimentalities. I personally feel that when I say living, it means longer than staying, something which is more permanent in relation to staying which might be temporary. So, it is the longer residence with it that increases its significance and experience for them. Bruises left by the sudden wrath and destruction of the river also however calm down. People get accustomed to this inner complaint. Living means being there in both its bad and good; when you cannot always expect to be perfect but love it nonetheless with its occasional hiccups to let go. \nThe world is a small place to accommodate this huge chunk of people, so humans have always attempted to settle down whosesoever they find a small patch of land even if it is in the middle of the river and sometimes in a tiny little boat. There is probably a river in each of our lives. The literal reflection on the water can also be seen as a kind of mirror reflection of the boatman and the river living with and in each other. Channelizing energy though each other.`,

    writeup: `These pictures were taken as part of my MPhil research in Majuli to understand the Re-theorizing livelihood practices due to twin process of flood and river bank erosion, soil and its materiality for community also how it has changed over decades.
        The manifestation of flood in Assam has been a perennial occurrence in Brahmaputra valley and it has been boon and sorrow for the community at the same time. The potter community ‘Kumars’ from Salmora (Majuli. Assam) expressed this artistry has been the mainstay of the livelihood and income as the men from the household sail to Sadia, Tezpur, Lakhimpur districts and other neighboring districts to sell the pots on their country made boats. The income generated from it is used a means of sustenance to cope from deluge. However, due to the rapid flood and river bank erosion, it has been continuously eroding/washing away the ‘Kumar matti’ shown in first and second picture used by the potters as they face existential crisis of their traditional livelihood and it has been now dwindling due to the rapid floods. Kumar community from both Dakhinpat Kumar Gaon and Salmora has gone through a major crisis due to river bank erosions per se; the loss of specific types of soil for pottery making has created threat for the traditional livelihood acutely. This in turn affects the islander primarily women potters’ source of income. As seen in the first picture this type of clay is obtained from clay pits from about twenty-five to thirty feet depth near the river banks and the sources for this clay are extremely limited. Largely, this clay can be procured from riverbanks, which is constantly eroding. Over the year the traditional potters are forced to use sand or use inferior quality soil (a type of soil locally called ‘Lodha-maati’) this not only gives the pots a low-quality finish but also potters get less price for such pots.`,

The river was silent and had a majestic view during the sunset. I went to Tezpur for an internship at DRL, DRDO and when I had this opportunity to visit the Ganesh Ghat, I grabbed it as soon as I could. I know the beauty of Ganges back at my city Kolkata and so I wanted to see Brahmaputra eagerly. I was overwhelmed with joy when I first saw the Brahmaputra and so was my friend who accompanied me. It was so pleasant and beautiful.`,

    title: ` Biodiversity of the river`,
    writeup: `The Brahmaputra basin which extends from the high elevated Tibet to the floodplains of Bangladesh, offers a biodiverse setup on which numerous natural habitats flourish. Meadows, rainforest, wetland, grassland, riverbank are some of the well-known habitats where the ecology thrives. Among these exists a lesser-known ecosystem which is often looked either in terms of engineering or human aspect; the flood-plain sediments or vernacularly called as Char-Chaporis. It is a highly dynamic landform present pre-dominantly in the floodplains. They undergo alterations every post monsoon flood, making the Char-Chapori ecosystem sensitive and fragile. However, little is known about the biodiversity of Char-Chaporis. \nFlood-plain sediments primarily hold several species of grasses such as Saccharum spontaneum, Saccharum ravennae, Phragmite sp. etc. These grasses play a vital role in holding the soil of the Char-Chapori which reduces the extent of erosion. In addition to protecting the soil, these grasses also provide suitable habitat for the growth of fauna. Many avian species find the grassland apt for nesting and breeding, such as Swamp Grass Babbler, Striated Grassbird, Graceful Prinia etc. Migratory bird species such as White-tailed Stonechat, Bristled Grassbird etc. too successfully breed in these habitats. \nHumans too have been seasonally inhabiting alongside the flora and fauna of Char-Chaporis for decades now. These floodplain-sediments provide excellent ecosystem services by creating a platform for cattle grazing during the non-monsoon seasons. The grass which grows are used as fodder for livestock. Seasonal agriculture is also practiced on the land which has become one of the primary sources of livelihood for the dwellers. However, a negative impact on the biodiversity can be observed with the accelerating rate of dependence on the ecosystem. Rampant clearing of the grasses is leading to faster erosion, followed by loss of habitat. Char-Chaporis outside protected area are usually overlooked by the Government bodies putting a threat to this unique biodiversity. On the other hand, dependence of Char dwellers on the land and biodiversity can only be reduced by providing them with sufficient livelihood opportunities. Additionally, research to investigate the diversity of species within the Char-Chapori is needed which can provide way forward for conservation.`,

    title: `River as a source of livelihood, River infrastructure`,
    writeup: `“River as a source of livelihood”\n The Brahmaputra river has always provided resources and livelihoods to the people living on the banks of the river. In an Agri-centric state like Assam, agriculture and fishing are two of the main livelihoods for many people, especially in the villages and also an opportunity for entrepreneurship. Fish is a stable dietary element of the people in this region. For people who relies on fishing for their livelihood, Brahmaputra and its tributaries are the primary natural sources for fishing due to the abundance of aquatic animals in these water bodies. For some fishermen, the day starts at the dawn and sometimes even before the sunrise. They sail on the river on their boats, along with their fishing instruments, to certain pre-identified locations where the chances of catching fish are high. After the early morning fishing, they direct themselves to the markets to sell the fresh fish and generate the day’s income. Some may also choose to go door-to-door on their bicycle and asking with their unique tone to buy some fish. Others will fish during day time till afternoon, and then head to the nearest urban market in the evening. To another section of people, fishing can also be a daily secondary activity to generate some extra income. Fishing is a direct economic contribution of the river to people’s lives, both as a source of income and as a food. \n\n“River Infrastructure”\nThe Brahmaputra is the widest river in India as well in the Asian sub-continent and bridges are one of the most challenging and important infrastructures associated with this mighty river with major social and economic impact. The Saraighat bridge (old), Inaugurated in the year of 1962, is the first major rail-cum-road bridge over the river. This well-designed mega structure has faced the test of time and still stands strong as the prime symbol of achievement of infrastructural development on Brahmaputra. The bridge carries a significant economic importance as it connects the north bank of the river to the Guwahati city, which is also the economic gateway to the North-East India. An exotic view of the grandiosity of the river flowing downstream and the scenic beauty of the river will be absorbed by anyone’s eyes who crosses over the bridge. Sunset is one of the most beautiful experiences when, as if, the mighty river’s water meets the vastness of the sky at the horizon and the whole scene is painted with the flaming colors of the setting sun. This picture brings the beautiful Saraighat bridge also under the colors as a way to bring all the elements of nature and man-made miracles together. The Saraighat bridge brings an both emotion of appreciation and excellence to anyone who belongs to this land and has experienced the river. It was an attempt to fulfill a fascinati`,

In the vast Ganges Delta, it merges with the Padma, the popular name of theriver Ganges in Bangladesh, and finally, after merging with Padma, it becomes the Meghna andfrom here, it flows as Meghna river before emptying into the Bay of Bengal.\nAbout 3,848 km (2,391 mi) long, the Brahmaputra is an important river for irrigation andtransportation in the region. The average depth of the river is 30 m (98 ft) and its maximumdepth is 135 m (443 ft) (at Sadiya). The river is prone to catastrophic flooding in the spring whenthe Himalayan snow melts. The average discharge of the river is about 19,800 m3/s (700,000cu ft/s),and floods reach about 100,000 m3/s (3,500,000 cu ft/s).It is a classic example of abraided river and is highly susceptible to channel migration and avulsion. It is also one of thefew rivers in the world that exhibits a tidal bore. It is navigable for most of its length.The river drains the Himalayan east of the Indo-Nepal border, south-central portion of theTibetan plateau above the Ganga basin, south-eastern portion of Tibet, the Patkai-Bum hills, thenorthern slopes of the Meghalaya hills, the Assam plains, and the northern portion ofBangladesh. The basin, especially south of Tibet, is characterized by high levels of rainfall.Kangchenjunga (8,586 m) is the only peak above 8,000 m, hence is the highest point within theBrahmaputra basin.\nThe Brahmaputra's upper course was long unknown, and its identity with the Yarlung Tsangpowas only established by exploration in 1884–86. This river is often called theTsangpo-Brahmaputra river.\nThe lower reaches are sacred to Hindus. While most rivers on the Indian subcontinent havefemale names, this river has a rare male name. Brahmaputra means "son of Brahma" inSanskrit.\n\nThank you!\nJunaid Ahmad Khan`,

These images captured near the Uzan Bazar ghat in Guwahati, gives us an idea about the lives of the people of these communities and their work culture. The fishermen venture out deep into the vastness of the Brahmaputra early in the morning. After they return with their catch, they may sell the fish directly in the nearby markets or sell it to different vendors. A major part of the fish catch is marketed fresh in the local fishmarkets. Located at the Uzan Bazar ghat at the south bank of the Brahmaputra, the Uzan Bazar fish market is one of the largest in the region. This market never fails to impress a fish lover with its huge variety. The place is vastly crowded in the morning hours as plenty of people rush to grab their share of freshly caught fish from the market. The Uzan Bazar fish market holds great significance as the livelihoods of the local fishermen and fish vendors are primarily dependent on the market and the river. It also gives an impression of the rich fishing culture of the native people. This is a beautiful example of how the Brahmaputra supports the lives of many local communities and boosts their businesses.`,

But how much is too much? \nThe view isn’t pretty from the other side.`,

    title: `Biodiversity of Brahmaputra`,
    writeup: `The Brahmaputra River is a biodiversity hotspot with a unique ecosystem that has received little attention. It is one of the few rivers in the world to have a riverine dolphin, the Gangetic River Dolphin and a very rare riverine shark, the Ganges Shark. Aside from the diverse range of fishes and mammals found in this river system, it is home to many endemic species of birds like the Swamp Grass Babbler, Marsh Babbler, Black-breasted Parrotbill and the Bengal Florican. Because of increased human pressure and unsustainable agricultural practises along river banks and "char-chaporis"(river islands), the populations of most of these bird species have become highly fragmented. Furthermore, during the winters, the same areas serve as non-breeding grounds for a large number of migratory birds, many of which are threatened species. \nEvery year, the dynamic changes that occur destroy and create new habitats. But, riverine grasslands play a critical role in slowing erosion. The river banks and char-chaporis are home to a variety of grasses and plants from the genus Saccharum, Typha, Tamarix, and others. \nMany of these grasses are used for nest making by grassland specialist birds. Unfortunately, these grasses are harvested in excess and sold as fodder. The grazing of livestock in these grasslands also degrades the grasslands' quality. They also aid in the propagation of weeds in these grasslands, speeding up the rate of succession. Similarly, sand mining is rampant in some areas, and it is only getting worse as time goes on. \nGrasslands are ploughed down or burned to make way for agriculture. While common birds adapt well, many grassland endemics flee to find suitable habitats away from agricultural patches. Because of these unsustainable agricultural practises, sometimes entire chars are eroded away in an year's flood. As a matter of fact, it is critical to thoroughly understand the biodiversity of the Brahmaputra, and initiatives for conservation and proper management of riverine grasslands should be undertaken before it is too late`,
    bio: `I work as a veterinary microbiologist in Guwahati. I've been there for three years. I completed my master's degree in Veterinary Microbiology at Khanapara College of Veterinary Science. I am a bird watcher who has been exploring the Brahmaputra char-chapori complexes.

    writeup: `As monsoons urge on the raging waters of the mad river, lands of the river-banks fall unceasingly to the relentless. The high, concrete walls on banks of the urban areas hold a fight. The wall defies the water. The villages witness the wrath as lands and wells and fields are engulfed to the unsated watery hunger. \n“We have to build a wall too.”\n “Yes, we do.”\n “Like the ones in the city. They protect the shops and the cycles, the poles and the dogs.”\n “We will make a wall too.”\n “Yes, we do.”\n The idea to create a wall presented itself directly out of the circumstantial influences in the site. The surrounding shapes of the land added to the inspiration, reflecting themselves in the form and material of the intervention.\nThe absurdity of a grass wall used to stop a relentless force of nature expands upon the complex relationship of the community with the river, and their risky existence along its banks. The work contextualizes the irony of the river appearing as a threat to riverine communities, and at the same time, facilitating these literal straws of grass, upon which the villagers of Baladmari Char 1 hang on to during days of peril. \nThe site for wall-making becomes a point of gathering and exchange through dialogue, and extends itself as a symbolic statement in the context of the social and cultural history of Baladmari. \nUndoubtedly, most of the wall is washed away within few hours. A section which remains is morphed into a temporal exhibition space of photographs made around the site during the process of wall-making. The re-activation of the space is intended to generate an impression of the action that outlasts its temporary being.`,

    writeup: `The pictures I have submitted represent the crucial bonding of human beings with the river Brahmaputra. \nEmpires and civilizations have risen and fallen around many rivers: Euphrates, Tigris, Nile, Amazon, Mekong, Indus, and Yellow river. However, Brahmaputra remained shrouded in mystery until the mid-17th century when geographers started exploring the regions. The hypothesis that a great lake exists in the Tibetan plateau finally saw the light of the day with the publication of D’Anville’s map, but it was unclear whether the lake was the true source of the river Brahmaputra. With the coming of the British in the Northeastern region in the first quarter of 18th century, and hypothesis based on Rennell’s expeditions, they finally put the issue to rest that Yarlung-Tsangpo is indeed Brahamputra. \nIt wouldn’t be wrong if I say Brahmaputra River is a sort of trail marker for early human migration. Following the river, nomads met settlers, settlement became civilization, civilization gave birth to kingdoms and new cultures. Despite the devastating floods the river brings forth each year, humans continue to idolise it with divinity—a guardian-angel who looks after the fate of this majestic valley and its people. \nThe four pictures represent the two intangible characters of our daily lives with the river: our faith and livelihood. The very water we pray, drink, and bathe in reflects a far greater truth: the truth of flowing time that nothing is permanent in this world, neither happiness nor sorrow.`,

    title: `Impacts of Brahmaputra on livelihood and its erosional problems`,
    writeup: `Pic 1\nHuman civilization has forever sought a water body to survive and grow; the banks of a river have been the most preferred location for human proliferation and growth. History is replete with such instances where rivers have been the melting pots of civilizations; in fact, many civilizations have been named after the rivers beside which they have grown. The Brahmaputra has been no different as the chequered Assamese civilization has grown along its northern and southern banks. Besides, the Brahmaputra Valley has attracted other civilizations to survive and thrive on its fertile banks. That there has been a demographic imbalance due to this is another matter altogether.\nFishing has been the traditional occupation of the Kaivarta community since the time of human habitation on the island. The land form, its water level, aquatic plants and seasonal variations are the guiding and significant factors of the occupation. It plays a significant role in maintaining the natural cycle and hence sustaining the ecological value of the area. Fishing is one of the main sources of livelihood for a section of people in Majuli. It is practiced by mostly scheduled caste and tribes like Mishings and Deories. The different types of water bodies of Majuli Island are the main resources. They include the wet land, marshy land, ponds, rivulets etc. Different fishing techniques have been evolved by man based on the level of water and probability of fishes.\nPic 2\nThe river Brahmaputra has been the lifeline of northeastern India since ages. This mighty river runs for 2880 kms through China, India and Bangladesh. Any alluvial river of such magnitude has problems of sediment erosion-deposition attached with it; the Brahmaputra is no exception. The problems of flood, erosion and drainage congestion in the Brahmaputra basin are gigantic. The Brahmaputra river is characterized by its exceedingly large flow, enormous volume of sediment load, continuous changes in channel morphology, rapid bed aggradations and bank line recession and erosion. The river has braided channel in most of its course in the alluvial plains of Assam. The lateral changes in channels cause severe erosion along the banks leading to a considerable loss of good fertile land each year. Bank oscillation also causes shifting of outfalls of its tributaries bringing newer areas under waters. Thousands of hectares of agricultural land is suffering from severe erosion continuously in the Brahmaputra basin covering parts of states like Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Nagaland and Manipur`,

I happened to see another set of people who were loading their cycles with variety of fishes to sell across the city presumably.

    writeup: `The mighty river Brahmaputra has provided the people of Assam and all the regions it flows through with not only food and water but also has provided the people with a source of employment. Fresh water fishing is the primary source of income for hundreds if not thousands of people living by this mighty river. For centuries, hundreds of families have been dependent on the river for their food, clean water and fishing as an employment opportunity. River based fisheries are of particular importance in the tropical regions as they provide food and nutrition to millions of people and support their livelihood. In recent times, the ever-increasing demands of water for irrigation, agriculture, domestic and industrial use and hydropower generation have impacted the river flow and habitats and consequently the fisheries and river-fish dependent communities. It is really sad to see that these communities of people who have been fishing in and around the waters of the mighty Brahmaputra are slowly being displaced due to increased demand of water supply and the international politics with China as the river originates there. \n The Assamese and Bengali population are very fond of fish and thus every morning the markets of Guwahati are flooded with hundreds of kilograms of fish. While we people love to consume fish almost every single day, we hardly think about the communities of fisherman who literally wake up in the middle of the night to go out into the river to meet our demand of fish every single day. Having spoken to a few of them, I’ve come to know about the hardships they face and would personally like to thank them for their contribution to our society. My photographs display these fisherman hard at work and also the various methods and traditional techniques of catching fish using bamboo and nets.`,

    writeup: `Brahmaputra doesn’t just flow as a river in Assam. It flows through the myriad histories, cultures, and folklores of the people in the land. It is also a source of livelihood for many. People have always depended on the river to provide and support them for a living from time immemorial. Brahmaputra’s thriving social and economic exchanges have made the river a living lifeline in the State. The exchanges come in various activities- trade, transportation, farming, irrigation, fishery, etc. to name just a few. Brahmaputra has also played an important role in creating a bustling fish trade in Guwahati. One such example can be seen in Guwahati’s Maas Ghat (Fish Port) situated on the river bank in an old locality of Uzan Bazaar. This market comes to live in the wee hours of the day. The activities start with fisherman providing their fresh catch to the traders (whole sellers) who bid the fishes. A flock of individual buyers also crowd the place as the people of Assam are avid fish lovers. Then there are small sellers who buy fish at whole sale rate from Maas Ghat and goes on to different localities in Guwahati to sell their day’s stock of fish. They often can be seen carrying an aluminium drum tied into their bicycles selling fishes crying out loud Maas Lage (want fish) in the residential areas of Guwahati. The livelihoods of many are dependent on this river. From catching fish in Brahmaputra to making them reach into the Assamese kitchen there is an extensive network at play. The river has helped shaped not only the economic life of many in the land but also sustained cultures and livelihoods in ways that connect people in intricate ways.`,

The joyous ride, over the course of river Brahmaputra is itself soothing. \nThe river is integral to the lives of the people of Guwahati. My college, the Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati boasts its presence right beside the river to the north of the city of Guwahati. Out through the gates of the campus, and you are enchanted by the mighty Brahmaputra. Sitting by the banks of the river, watching the river turn golden, with the sun setting far in the west not only comforts the mind, but also enriches the soul. And if you spot a dolphin jumping through the gushing waters, the thrill is unparalleled. \nThe river has been witness to countless emotions and myriad stories of the people that it shares the path with. The sorrows of the floods and the hope that it brings, with the water that it carries, from far away mountains, holds within them the tales of lives, that it touches every day. Meandering its way through, the river is the essence of life, in its various distinct forms. Thinking of it, I go back to the evening, I saw her in full delight, the very first time.`,

    writeup: `Over the years, there were two key national policies - the “Beautiful countryside” and “Beautiful river and lakes” that light the path for facilitating between the man and Yarlung-Zangbo River to achieve the ecological civilization.\n
        Countryside: Some may say to build a lush green countryside full of green plants and enchantments that embrace your soul, you need to create beautiful countryside. To do so, retain the idyllic scenery of birds and flowers, enable the people to see mystic mountains, and let everyone wonder about the purity of shared waters that may remind their homes.\n
        Rivers: An old proverb says to preserve safe, healthy and happy rivers providing mutual prosperity between man and nature, create beautiful rivers and lakes. What you need is to ensure clear waters, green shores, fish gliding at shallow bottoms before your patience and determination to reach harmony with local environments come true.\n
        In other words, when local communities find their way to live alongside the lucid waters and blooming mountains it not only makes people proud of their villages but also bring them hope and other opportunities for their better future. Therefore, when the shared waters will be preserved and the local environments adequately restored, only then the people will better understand the invaluable assets and feel the unforeseen benefits coming from mother nature.\n`,

  //     writeup: `Explode \nTowards the banks of River Brahmaputra in Horipur in Gaibandha district of Bangladesh, many communities residing around the river banks are directly connected to their rivers for their livelihood. Fishing is one of the main occupation for the riverine communities. But with frequent flash flood, the communities living in char island around River Brahmaputra in Bangladesh lives a live of constant threat and displacement. This displacement and insecurity also costs their livelihood. \nFinding an alternative and fast income generating methods, seen in the picture are two men carrying a dynamite to kill fish so that those fishes can be sold for their survival. Old fisher folks around the river banks does not approve of the method. Elders show discomfort for such practices. The dynamite is exploded inside the river so that fish can be killed instantly. The practice not only harms the fish but disrupts the riverine health and surrounding ecosystem. This practice has also costed lives of fisher folks of the region.\n \nFerry to go home\n \nMishing is a largest river community of Assam dispersed around various tributaries of River Brahmaputra. They also live in one of the world's largest river island called Majuli. As a riverine tribe, Mising indicates blend of mi ‗man‘ and asi ‗water‘. The Mising consider themselves to be the descendent of the Sun and Moon. On all auspicious occasions, the Sun is referred to Ane Do:nyi- ‗Mother Sun‘ and the Moon who they call Abu Po:lo ‗Father Moon‘ are worshiped. \nPeople of Assam referred to Mishing as Miri. According to E. A. Gait, the word Miri means middle man in Assamese words. They acted as a channel of communication between the people of Assam and Abors of Arunachal Pradesh. \nFerries and boats are the only lifeline which connects people to the mainland. Women are rare travellers in the ferry as men dominates the passenger ratio. Women in the boat are seen either with a new born baby, visiting her family or to check ailments to nearby hospitals in mainland. With half the male population outside the island for work or better education, these women spends most of the time weaving, tending farms, cooking or battling flood during monsoon season. Climate related disasters with women in rural areas often go unrecorded while they are directly related to accessing natural resources like water and forest for their daily consumption. Looking at the vastness of the River Brahmaputra, a Mishing woman is seen looking at the river from the ferry as though the river is the only companion and her gold earring, the only wealth. The narratives around women and their relationship with river often goes through many layers.\n \nLove across the ‘Brohmaputra Nodi’\n Mishing is a marginalised riverine population of River Brahmaputra. They believe themselves to be the descendent of Donyi Polo – Mother Sun and Father Moon respectively. Mishing practices a patriarchal system. After the marriage a girl lives with her husband‘s family. Generally formal marriage called – Da : roMidang is a formal marriage where social norms are followed. Parents of both boys and girls negotiate for this union. Dugla la nam i.e marriage by elopement is a common practice form of marriage. Formal marriages are very expensive and if the Mishing community is unable to sustain the cost of formal marriage then Mishing village heads and society encourages this practice. Otherwise, the boys and girl choose such type of marriage system if family‘s oppose to the marriage. And Kumna sola La:nam i.e a marriage through a simple ceremony does not have a heavy cost. Usually the less affluent section of the people due to poverty or inconvenience practise such system of marriage. Marriage is celebrated by inviting elders and offering Apong (rice beer) to them. \nSoon to be Mishing bridegroom waits with his family for the boat with gifts for the bride's family to cross the River Brahmaputra and get his bride from Majuli island. They are crossing the river with Apong (local drink), Tamul (beetle nut) and fish for the bride's family. Dressed in traditional hand woven Mekhla Chador (pronounced Sador) which takes month to make the two-piece set and Gomcha (scarf for men), the bridegroom’s family wait for the boat eagerly. \nThe bride’s happiness is just across the River Brahmaputra.\n \nThe Confluence \nRiver Brahmaputra and River Teesta are two major transboundary rivers of South Asia which meets at Bangladesh in a place called Chilmari. Both of these rivers originates in Mighty Himalaya and meanders through the mountains of India to meet at Chilmari which lies in the northern part of Bangladesh bordering India. Chilmari has many river islands (chars). When huge dams and Barrage opens gates in the upstream rivers of India especially during the monsoon, places like Chilmari are the first to witness flash floods and soil erosion. Many communities living in this area are landless and experiences extreme poverty and displacement. \nSeen in the picture is a confluence of River Teesta with River Brahmaputra at the backdrop with a boat containing many such displaced communities of Chilmari. At the foreground, ‘belli phool’ also known as Jasmine flower was plucked freshly by the river bank to offer to the confluence. A large Indian banyan leaf was commonly found. Jasmine flowers were offered along with the Indian banyan leaf. These two entity of the river confluence symbolises the presence of similar ecosystem along these transboundary rivers. The flower and the leaf celebrates the interconnectedness of the riverine biodiversity.\n \nAdapting like a water \nPinky Pame was born between the confluence of Subansiri river and River Brahmaputra. She migrated from her village to further her college but married young. As a new daughter in law of the house, she sits by the hearth to prepare pork meat for guests which is offered with rice and Apong (rice beer). Rice is the staple food of the Mishing. Apong is a special drink served and offered in various ceremonial functions and in worshipping of spirits. \nThe flood is a norm for riverine people community like Mishing, especially during rainy season. She lives in a typical Mishing house called ‘Changhar‘ – a thatched house , raised about 4 -5 feet from the ground with a bamboo and wooden stilts. She lives with her husband and his family. Sometimes, while she is cooking, pigs run below the house as her new family breeds pigs. During the night, ‘fireflies’ called ‘Junaki’ is seen flying through the crevices of the floor. It is a platform house which is traditionally known as Taleng Okum. They serve the dual purpose of keeping floodwaters and wild animals at bay. \nThese kind of houses are easy to construct and elevation levels of the houses can be changed depending upon the floods of the previous year. Higher the water level than the previous year, more elevated are subsequent houses built. During the time of flood, as a child Pinky remembers her maternal house to have a boat to move about for their daily chores. But, with forest cover reducing, logging banned and wood becoming scarce, cheaper replacements like bamboo rafts, wood or banana stems are being used to navigate through floodwaters. \nNow, she is a proud mother of a boy.`,

  //     writeup: `River as a space for women\n The Brahmaputra river might reflect a gendered perspective from its very name, ‘Son of Lord Brahma’. The river is being regarded as ‘male’ for the incomparable, mighty-armed Brahmaputra has been rolling on down the ages, bearing witness to the struggles of the riparian communities. However, the infinite horizon of the Brahmaputra has embraced a thousand tales of brave and bold women of the land of Assam. The Brahmputra resides in every Assamese heart as the Luit (another name of Brahmaputra in Assam). The banks of the Luit still reverberates the voices of revolutionary women like Mula Gabharu, Sati Joymoti, Kanaklata Baruah, Chandraprabha Saikiani, and such other valiant figures who lived, fought, and died for the pride and sovereignty of the Luit. The rustling sound of the Luit waters inspires every woman of the land, far and wide, to dream, be bold, and be empowered to fight life’s odds. The ceaseless flows of the Brahmaputra are a reminder that dreams have no boundaries and this is what is rooted in every woman of today. In short, the Brahmaputra has sustained a land of equality where no gender biases exist, and together, every being strives to build up a new Assam. \n\nUrban Floods\n Being an unplanned city with sprawling urbanization, Guwahati, the biggest city on the south banks of the mighty Brahmaputra in Assam encounters a nightmare with a single heavy shower. With the surrounding green hills being deforested and flattened, the urban dwellers residing on the plains often experience havoc from flash floods. \n<em>“Oh what has man made of nature! \nFor today the Luit is furious and growling, \nMaking inroads into peaceful places of dwellings; \nDisturbing the tranquility of innocent hearts \nBestowing fears and tears of sorrow, \nBreaking dreams of a blissful tomorrow.”</em>`,
  //     bio: `Born and brought up and, currently residing by the south banks of the mighty Brahmaputra. As a child, grew up singing the famous song by Jyotiprasad Agarwala, "Luitore pani jabi o' boi.." as taught by my mother (who also bears the name of the river, "Luit") and coincidently, today I am researching on the Brahmaputra river as a PhD scholar from IIT Guwahati, India. The Brahmaputra has and will always reside in my heart.`,
